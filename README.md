# Popping-Balloons-Game
This is a game I developed as a part of my computer science class. It uses
tkinter and classes to create a game of popping balloons. As time goes on 
the balloons change position and deflate. A user gets points if they pop
the balloons (the number of points is equal to the current radius of the
balloon). The user can adjust the speed of deflation, size of balloons, 
number of balloons and the interval by which the balloon moves.
